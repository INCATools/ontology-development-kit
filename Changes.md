# v1.2.20 (2 January 2020)
- updated ROBOT to version 1.5.0
- base modules now get a special "base module" ontology annotation
- some bug fixes of the makefile process:
  - pattern file download
  - simple seed now takes into account annotation properties 
  - subset annotation handling improved

# v1.2.19 (21 October 2019)
- added functionality to update the repository after changing the yaml config. **This feature is still experimental.** To make use of this, you need to update your Makefile and copy the file under src/scripts/update_repo.sh in the respective folder of your repository. You should then be able  to run `sh run.sh make update_repo` to get your whole repo to the latest state. Be careful though: some files like the Makefile, run.sh and the sparql queries are considered native to ODK; this update routine will overwrite those files. Therefore, check your git diff before committing anything you might not want. 
- similar to `sh run.sh make IMP=false prepare_release`, it is now possible to skip pattern generation when creating a release `sh run.sh make PAT=false prepare_release`
- Bug fix to component pipeline
- Bug fix to report print out
- You can now exclude tautologies from your releases, such as Nothing SubClassOf Nothing or similar. For more information about this brand new ROBOT feature see http://robot.obolibrary.org/reason#excluding-tautologies. You can change the default behaviour by adding `exclude_tautologies: false` or `exclude_tautologies: all` to your yaml config.
- Bug fix to how external.txt is handled (pattern pipeline)

# v1.2.18 (13 September 2019)
- Upgrade ROBOT to version 1.4.3
- Minor bug fix in handling temporary file directories

# v1.2.17 (10 September 2019)
- Bug fix Konclude reasoner invocation
- Bug fix simple seed generation
- Bug fix: main owl release file (ont.owl) now has the correct version IRI
- More debugging output during seeding process
- Updated some of the documentation to be more generic towards GitHub vs GitLab and others 
- Highly experimental features (not for production) that allows the use of GitHub api for making a GitHub [release programmatically](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/268/files). For an example config see [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/examples/tests/test-github-release.yaml). This feature is likely to change significantly over time. 
- The ODK version is now written into the Makefile, and is printed by default during runs of the ODK
- Bug fix that caused OBO file releases to have broken subset declarations (injection of subset annotation property by default in imports).
- It is now possible to tag releases with the date of release. Use: `release_date: True` in the configuration file 


# v1.2.16
*Major revisions of Makefile*

- *NOTE: for some of the new goals, a tmp directory is required in src/ontology directory (src/ontology/tmp)*
- Use ont.Makefile file to extend your default ODK make pipeline (which continues to be in src/ontology/Makefile). See [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/blob/master/src/ontology/hp.Makefile) for an example;
- Use `allow_equivalents: assert-only` or `allow_equivalents: none` in your project configuration file ([Example](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/examples/phenotype-ontologies/mp-odk.yaml)).
- Integrate components in your projects. A component is a part of your ontology that is managed somewhere outside of the edit file, for [example](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/examples/phenotype-ontologies/wbphenotype-odk.yaml) and external file with logical definitions, or a set of xrefs imported from an external file.
  ```
  components:
    products:
      - filename: wbphenotype-equivalent-axioms-subq.owl
  ```
- you can now supply a different catalog.xml then the default by adding a line to your config file: `catalog_file: catalog-v001.xml`
- You can now run the [Konclude](http://derivo.de/en/products/konclude/) reasoner. See [here](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-phenotype-ontology/blob/master/src/ontology/dpo.Makefile) for an integrated example.
- new release artefacts, which are documented [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/ReleaseArtefacts.md). Note that the simple and basic releases are currently highly experimental; we are working on maturing them.
- it is now possible to skip git related operations during the seeding process: `./seed-via-docker.sh -c --skipgit True -C odkconfig.yaml`. This is useful if the goal is to quickly regenerate the Makefile for example in the context of upgrading a repository.
- it is now possible to set [dates from the outside of the docker](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/232) container as a parameter.
- it is now possible to run a OBO validor (see [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/215))

# v1.2

**MAJOR OVERHAUL OF FRAMEWORK**

This release sees the introduction of project.yaml files (see
[examples/](examples)). Although command line passing of parameters is
still supported, the use of a project file is strongly encouraged.

Previously the following commands may be have been passed: `-c -d pato -d cl -d ro -t my-ontology myont`

Now you can use a yaml file:

```
id: myont
title: my ontology
import_group:
  products:
   - id: ro
   - id: cl
   - id: pato
```

## Changes for Users

 * project.yaml files can be passed instead of command line settings
 * Docker container can now be executed anywhere, no checkout required
 * Added [README-developers.md](README-developers.md) for ODK developers
 * Docker container tracking ROBOT v1.2
 * Previously multiple dependencies: `-d ont1 ont2 ... ontN`, now `-d ont1 -id ont2 ... -d ontN`
 * New command line option `--source` to pass in an existing ontolgy-edit file

## Changes for ODK Developers

 * Dockerfile for odkfull now at root directory
 * Dockerfile now based on alpine
 * Perl script gone; new python script (Python3.6 required)
 * Uses Jinja2 templating system, including dynamic file templating

## Migration Guide

This will be complex BUT the new system will make future development easier.

You MAY want to wait for future incremental releases which will
include migration tools. But if you want to forge ahead, we recommend
creating a new repo and copying files across manually.

# v1.1.3

## Changes

 * fixing bug in which running seed-via-docker did not enter interactive mode when no arguments provided
 * added convenience wrapper scripts

## Migration guide

 * New .sh scripts in src/ontology can be directly copied across

# v1.1.2

## Changes

 * added interactive mode
 * added [DOSDP](https://github.com/INCATools/dead_simple_owl_design_patterns/blob/master/src/simple_pattern_tester.py) support

## Docker

 * [odkfull](https://hub.docker.com/r/obolibrary/odkfull/tags/) v1.1.2 includes robot 1.1.0

## Migration guide

This release adds a new template in the `src/patterns` folder. These can be copied across to an existing repo.

# v1.1.1

## Changes

Name of repo has changed to ontology-developer-kit

 * changing name of docker image to odk
 * Upgrade dosdp-tools to release 0.9.
 * Make docker commands workable on windows
 * Dockerize travis
 * Imports automatically generated
 * Added python dosdp checker to docker, fixes #55
 * use robot not owltools in all places

## Docker

odklite and odkfull 1.1.1 released. Note that new versions may be released independent of odk

 * robot pre-1.1.0
 * dosdp-tools 0.9

The docker release includes a pre-release of [robot 1.1.0](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
This is identical to 1.1.0, except for https://github.com/ontodev/robot/commit/928503b1303c139fc1cf4fc1939d64bda0f2ae30

## Migration guide

If you built your repo from a previous version of ODK, here is a rough guide to migrating:

 * Update your .travis.yml, in order to use Docker (optional but recommended)
 * change the name of the docker image to odkfull in your run.sh

# 1.1.0

 * Add a run.sh in the template for Docker
