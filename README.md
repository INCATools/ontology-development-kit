# Requirements

To run this kit to generate a new ontology repo, you will need

 1. [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
 2. A git client

It is possible to do this without docker, see below for instructions

# Generating an ontology project

## 1. Download the ontology development kit

It's recommended you get a release version: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/releases

## Initialize

TODO: UPDATE DOCS FOR NEW PYTHON odk.py - NOT YET WRAPPED IN DOCKER

First you must be in the root level of the kit

    cd ontology-development-kit

The `seed-via-docker.sh` command does everything you need. For help:

    ./seed-via-docker.sh  -h

(Windows user: replace `seed-via-docker.sh` with `seed-via-docker.bat`)

The very first time you run this it may be slow, while docker downloads necessary images. Subsequent runs should be much faster!

NEW: You can either pass in arguments on the command line, or use a `project.yaml` file. See the [examples](examples) folder for examples

For interactive mode, just run the script without any arguments:

    ./seed-via-docker.sh

An example:

    ./seed-via-docker.sh   -d po ro pato -u cmungall -t "Triffid Behavior ontology" triffo

Via a conf file:

    ./seed-via-docker.sh   -d po ro pato -u cmungall -t "Triffid Behavior ontology" triffo

You can list any set of dependencies you like after "-d". However, these must be the official OBO ontology IDs. See http://obofoundry.org for details.

This will create your starter files in
`target/triffid-behavior-ontology`. It will also prepare an initial
release and initialize a local repository (not yet pushed to GitHub).

You can customize at this stage, or (recommended) after making an initial push to github

## Push to GitHub

The development kit will automatically initialize a git project, add all files and commit.

You will need to create a project on GitHub.

 1. Go to: https://github.com/new
 2. The owner MUST be the org you selected with the `-u` option. The name MUST be the one you set with `-t`.
 3. Do not initialize with a README (you already have one)
 4. Click Create
 5. See the section under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"

Follow the instructions there. E.g.

```
cd target/triffid-behavior-ontology
git remote add origin git@github.com:cmungall/triffid-behavior-ontology.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: you can now mv `target/triffid-behavior-ontology` to anywhere you like in your home directory. Or you can do a fresh checkout from github

## Edit and release cycle

In your repo you will see a README-editors.md file that has been customized for your project. Follow these instructions.

Generally the cycle is to:

 - branch
 - the edit the edit.owl file
 - make test
 - git commit
 - git push

To make a release

`make prepare_release`

Note that any make step can be preceded by run.sh if you have Docker installed

## OBO Library metadata

The assumption here is that you are ahdering to OBO principles and
want to eventually submit to OBO. Your repo will contain stub metadata
files to help you do this.

You can create pull requests for your ontology on the OBO Foundry. See the `src/metadata` file for more details.

For more documentation, see http://obofoundry.org

## Additional

You will want to also:

 * enable travis
 * enable zenodo (optional)

See the README-editors.md file that has been generated for your project.

## Troubleshooting.

If you have issues, file them here: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues

Some things to check:

 * if something goes wrong you can try again. You may want to remove the `target` dir, or use the `-c` option
 * make sure your ontid has no spaces
 * if your title has spaces, enclose it in quotes


## Customizing

You will likely want to customize the build process, and of course to edit the ontology.

The main thing you will want to do is to modify the seeds that are
used to build the imports. The ones that are there are just examples,
edit them as you like. See the ROBOT docs and the [OBO
Tutorial](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obo-tutorial) for more
info.

## Adapting an existing ontology repo

The ODK is designed for creating a new repo for a new ontology. It can still be used to help figure out how to migrate an existing github repository to the ODK structure. There are different ways to do this.

 * Manually compare your ontology against the [template](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/template) folder and make necessary adjustments
 * Run the seed script as if creating a new repo. Manually compare this with your existing repo and use `git mv` to rearrange, and adding any missing files by copying them across and doing a `git add`
 * Create a new repo de novo and abandon your existing one, using github issue mover to move tickets across.
 
Obviously the second method is not ideal as you lose your github history. Note even with `git mv` history tracking becomes harder

If you have built your ontology using a previous version of ODK,
migration of your setup is unfortunately a manual process. In general
you do not absolutely *need* to upgrade your setup, but doing so will
bring advantages in terms of aligning with emerging standards ways of
doing things. The less customization you do on your repo the easier it
should be to migrate.

Consult the [Changes.md](Changes.md) file for changes made between
releases to assist in upgrading.
