Ontology Development Kit Guide
============

This guide is intended for maintainers and editors of OBO ontologies.

The first part of the guide is how to set up a new ontology
project. This requires some technical steps.

The second part of the guide is for day to day editing.

**NOTE** this guide is adapted from the GO editors guide. Some
instructions may still be too GO-specific.
